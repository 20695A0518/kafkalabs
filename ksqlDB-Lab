ksqlDB is a new kind of database purpose-built for stream processing apps, allowing users to build stream processing 
applications against data in Apache Kafka® and enhancing developer productivity.


Creating a New Stream
=====================

CREATE STREAM readings (
    sensor VARCHAR KEY,
    location VARCHAR,
    reading INT
) WITH (
    kafka_topic = 'readings',
    partitions = 3,
    value_format = 'json'
);



Inserting Rows into a Stream
============================

INSERT INTO readings (sensor, location, reading) VALUES ('sensor-1', 'wheel', 45);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, location, reading) VALUES ('sensor-2', 'motor', 41);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, location, reading) VALUES ('sensor-1', 'wheel', 42);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, location, reading) VALUES ('sensor-3', 'muffler', 42);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, location, reading) VALUES ('sensor-3', 'muffler', 40);

INSERT INTO readings (sensor, location, reading) VALUES ('sensor-4', 'motor', 43);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, location, reading) VALUES ('sensor-6', 'muffler', 43);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, location, reading) VALUES ('sensor-5', 'wheel', 41);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, location, reading) VALUES ('sensor-5', 'wheel', 42);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, location, reading) VALUES ('sensor-4', 'motor', 41);

INSERT INTO readings (sensor, location, reading) VALUES ('sensor-7', 'muffler', 43);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, location, reading) VALUES ('sensor-8', 'wheel', 40);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, location, reading) VALUES ('sensor-9', 'motor', 40);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, location, reading) VALUES ('sensor-9', 'motor', 44);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, location, reading) VALUES ('sensor-7', 'muffler', 41);


Transforming an Event Stream
============================

This persistent query transforms one stream (readings, above) into a new one called clean that has modified 
text to upper case in one field.

CREATE STREAM clean AS
SELECT sensor,
reading,
UCASE(location) AS location
FROM readings
EMIT CHANGES;


Filtering Rows out of a Stream
==============================

CREATE STREAM high_readings AS
    SELECT sensor, reading, location
    FROM clean
    WHERE reading > 41
    EMIT CHANGES;
    

Combining Stream Operations into One
====================================

To simplify what we’ve created, we must get rid of streams we do not need.

CREATE STREAM high_pri AS
    SELECT sensor,
           reading,
           UCASE(location) AS location
    FROM readings
    WHERE reading > 41
    EMIT CHANGES;
    
We can bypass the multiple streams by combining operations into a single new stream with more SQL.


Push Query
==========

This type of query pushes a continuous stream of updates to the client. These queries are particularly suitable for 
asynchronous application flows as they enable the clients to react to new information in real-time.

However, unlike persistent queries, the server does not store the results of such queries in a Kafka topic.

SELECT * FROM clean  WHERE reading > 41 EMIT CHANGES;



Client Code
============

Add the dependency for the client:

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.confluent.ksql</groupId>
    <artifactId>ksqldb-api-client</artifactId>
    <version>6.2.0</version>
</dependency>


An instance of the Client with ksqlDB server connection details and use this to execute our SQL statement:

ClientOptions options = ClientOptions.create()
  .setHost(KSQLDB_SERVER_HOST)
  .setPort(KSQLDB_SERVER_PORT);

Client client = Client.create(options);

Map<String, Object> properties = Collections.singletonMap(
  "auto.offset.reset", "earliest"
);

CompletableFuture<ExecuteStatementResult> result = 
  client.executeStatement(CREATE_READINGS_STREAM, properties);

Inserting Sample Data
=====================

List<KsqlObject> rows = Arrays.asList(
  new KsqlObject().put("sensor_id", "sensor-1")
    .put("timestamp", "2021-08-01 09:00:00").put("reading", 22),
  new KsqlObject().put("sensor_id", "sensor-1")
    .put("timestamp", "2021-08-01 09:10:00").put("reading", 20),
  new KsqlObject().put("sensor_id", "sensor-2")
    .put("timestamp", "2021-08-01 10:00:00").put("reading", 26),
  
  // additional rows
);

CompletableFuture<Void> result = CompletableFuture.allOf(
  rows.stream()
    .map(row -> client.insertInto(READINGS_TABLE, row))
    .toArray(CompletableFuture[]::new)
);


Push Query
==========

String ALERTS_QUERY = "SELECT * FROM alerts EMIT CHANGES";

public CompletableFuture<Void> subscribeOnAlerts(Subscriber<Row> subscriber) {
    return client.streamQuery(ALERTS_QUERY, PROPERTIES)
      .thenAccept(streamedQueryResult -> streamedQueryResult.subscribe(subscriber))
      .whenComplete((result, ex) -> {
          if (ex != null) {
              log.error("Alerts push query failed", ex);
          }
      });
}


Pull Query
==========

pull queries are well suited to synchronous request/response application flows.

Create a query to retrieve all the alerts triggered for a particular sensor id:

String pullQuery = "SELECT * FROM alerts WHERE sensor_id = 'sensor-2';";

List<Row> rows = client.executeQuery(pullQuery, PROPERTIES).get()
