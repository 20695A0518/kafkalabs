There are two properties that control the commit timeout in Kafka consumers:

max.poll.interval.ms: This property specifies the maximum time interval between two consecutive polls for new messages. If a consumer fails to poll
for new messages within this interval, the consumer will be considered dead and its partitions will be rebalanced to other active consumers. 
This property indirectly controls the commit timeout because the consumer must commit the offset before the next poll interval expires.

auto.commit.interval.ms: This property specifies the frequency at which the consumer's offset is automatically committed to the broker. The default 
value is 5000 ms (5 seconds), but it can be adjusted based on the use case and the volume of messages being processed. If a message takes longer than 
the auto-commit interval to process, the consumer may not have a chance to commit its offset before the next automatic commit is scheduled. Therefore, 
it's important to set this value high enough to allow the consumer to process messages and commit offsets within the same interval.

It's worth noting that if a consumer is processing messages asynchronously and takes a long time to process a message, it may exceed the commit timeout 
and cause the same message to be delivered twice. In such cases, the application may need to manually commit the offset after the message is processed 
to ensure that the consumer doesn't receive it again.


The producer provides several configuration options to control the connection timeout behavior:

bootstrap.servers: This property specifies the list of brokers that the producer should use to bootstrap its initial connection. It's important to 
provide a valid list of brokers that the producer can connect to, otherwise, it may fail to establish a connection.

max.block.ms: This property specifies the maximum amount of time the producer will block before throwing an exception if it cannot establish a 
connection with any of the specified brokers. The default value is 60,000ms (1 minute), but it can be adjusted based on the use case and the expected 
network latency.

retries: This property specifies the number of times the producer will retry connecting to a broker before giving up. The default value is 2147483647 
(maximum integer value), which means the producer will retry indefinitely until a connection is established. It's important to set a reasonable value 
for this property to avoid overloading the broker with connection requests.

retry.backoff.ms: This property specifies the amount of time the producer will wait before retrying a failed connection attempt. The default value is 
100ms, but it can be increased to reduce the load on the broker and improve the connection success rate.

By default, the producer will attempt to establish a connection to a broker as soon as it's initialized. However, it's possible to delay the connection 
attempt until the first message is sent by setting the linger.ms property to a non-zero value. This can help reduce the number of failed connection attempts 
and improve the overall performance of the producer.


 There are several properties that control how followers synchronize with the leader:

replica.fetch.min.bytes: This property specifies the minimum number of bytes that a follower replica should fetch from the leader. If the amount of 
data available on the leader is less than this value, the follower will wait until more data is available before fetching it. The default value is 1 byte, 
but it can be increased to reduce the number of fetch requests and improve network efficiency.

replica.fetch.max.bytes: This property specifies the maximum number of bytes that a follower replica can fetch from the leader in a single request. 
The default value is 1 MB, but it can be increased or decreased based on the expected size of messages and the available network bandwidth.

replica.fetch.wait.max.ms: This property specifies the maximum amount of time that a follower replica should wait for data to become available on the 
leader. If no new data is available within this time, the follower will send a fetch request to the leader anyway. The default value is 500 ms, but it 
can be increased or decreased based on the expected latency and the network conditions.

replica.fetch.backoff.ms: This property specifies the amount of time that a follower replica should wait before retrying a failed fetch request. 
The default value is 1000 ms, but it can be increased or decreased based on the expected latency and the network conditions.

replica.lag.time.max.ms: This property specifies the maximum time that a follower replica is allowed to be behind the leader before it's considered "lagging". 
If a follower is lagging by more than this amount of time, it will trigger a rebalance to redistribute the partitions among the available replicas.
The default value is 10,000 ms (10 seconds), but it can be increased or decreased based on the expected replication delay and the desired consistency level.


Producer retry property:
-------------------------

retry:
Type:	int
Default:	2147483647

retry.backoff.ms
By default, the producer will wait 100ms between retries, but you can control this using the retry.backoff.ms parameter
